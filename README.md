### Hello 👋

<div align="justify">
  I'm Manoel. I'm passionate about software development and strive to improve myself every day to transform people's lives through technology. If you ask me why I chose this field, I’ll probably say that programming made me stay up all night in a completely different way.

### Some Things That Are Indispensable in My Life 🤔

<ul align="justify">
  <li>🥋 I'm a big fan of <strong>martial arts</strong>. An important detail is that I focus on having fun rather than being the best because if I were the best, I wouldn't need to fight anymore. 😂</li>
  <li>🤖 I enjoy <strong>production processes</strong> that industries develop. It's amazing to see the entire <strong>automation</strong> system evolving and <strong>robots</strong> getting better and better.</li>
  <li>🏃🏻 Something I love to do, especially in my free time, is <strong>running</strong>. If you also have this hobby and want company, <strong>feel free to invite me.</strong></li>
  <li>🎮 I love <strong>games</strong>. If you ask me which one I like the most, I won't name a specific one, but <strong>shooting games (PC and console)</strong> and <strong>strategy games (board games)</strong> are the ones that attract me the most.</li>
  <li>👨🏻‍💻 Currently, I'm focused on learning more about <strong>back-end</strong>. At the beginning of my journey in back-end development, I learned about <strong>Java</strong> and its famous framework, <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. Regarding <strong>architecture</strong>, I have an understanding of the principles of <strong>MVC, SOLID, and DDD</strong>, but I'm eager to dive deeper into these concepts and absorb new ones.</li>
</ul>
